# Machine Learning  Projects

## üìö Project Overview
This repository contains three Machine Learning classification projects, each focusing on different domains and classification techniques:

1. **Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification:**  
   - Objective: Classify skin lesion images as 'benign' or 'malignant'.  
   - Techniques: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
   - Dataset: [Skin Lesion Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/171h-C3jDn-1HYqHslWh0LNn0OM-H5cGY/view).  

2. **Na√Øve Bayes Text Classification:**  
   - Objective: Perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews.  
   - Techniques: Na√Øve Bayes with unigram and bigram models.  
   - Dataset: [IMDB Sentiment Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).  

3. **Telecommunication Customer Classification:**  
   - Objective: Classify customers into four service categories based on demographic data.  
   - Techniques: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Weighted kNN.  
   - Dataset: Included in the repository (`telecommunicaton_classification.csv`).
